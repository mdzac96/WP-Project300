                     <h4><b>1 - </b>Registration</h4>
                     <p>If all your screening meets requirements, you will be directed to a donor bed in the donor room. A phlebotomist will clean your arm with an antiseptic and use a blood donation kit to draw blood from a vein in your arm. You will donate one unit of blood (about one pint). This takes about six to ten minutes.</p>

                        <h4><b>2 - </b>Seeing</h4>
                     <p>A man came into the emergency ward at one o'clock. His thumb came in an hour later. The surgeon's job: get them back together.The successful re-attaching of fingers to hand requires long hours of painstaking work in microsurgery. In the operating room , the surgeon doesn't stand, but sits in a chair that supports her body. Her arm is cradled by a pillow. Scalpels are present as are other standard surgical tools, but the suture threads are almost invisible, the needle thinner than a human hair. And all the surgical activity revolves around the most important instument, the microscope.The surgeon will spend the next few hours looking through the microscope at broken blood vessels and nerves and sewing them back together again.The needles are so thin that they have to be held with needlenosed jeweller's forceps and will sew together nerves that are as wide as the thickness of a penny. To make such a stitch, the surgeon's hands will move no more than the width of the folded side of a piece of paper seen end on!</p>

                        <h4><b>3 - </b>Donation</h4>
                     <p>A whole blood donation takes about 8-10 minutes, during which you'll be seated comfortably or lying down. When approximately a pint of whole blood has been collected, the donation is complete and a staff person will place a bandage on your arm.</p>

                        <h4><b>4 - </b>Save Life</h4>
                         <p>Donating blood also saves the life of the donor, as it is screened for infections like HIV and hepatitis C before being transfused.</p>
