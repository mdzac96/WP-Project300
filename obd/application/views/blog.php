                                <p>Young people are at a ten year low of giving blood. And that really made me think – I’m a young person and I have to admit I’ve never given blood. Why not? I’m not too sure really, it’s just one of those things I’ve always intended to do but have never got around to. Only 14% of regular donors are under 30, so it’s just not me. I thought I’d try and find out why.</p>

                                <p>Dr Fieldman said: “Children are powerfully influenced by their parents. Of course some children will rebel against their parents but they will also follow them in different ways. I think children will often – covertly, sometimes – follow their parents in being donors.”</p>

                                <p>You may have a friend or family member (or you know someone who has) who needs a blood donation to survive. Wouldn’t you want to help them? Well, it’s remarkably easy to do so – all you have to do is donate a unit of your blood and that small amount could be life-saving for someone important in your life.</p>

                                <p>For any not-for-profit or community supported organization you are only as good as your standing in the community. A sure way to screw up that support is by partnering with companies or products that are counter to your mission statement and that do not align with your goals. If it sounds like I am proposing you to steer clear of partners, you’ve been picking the wrong partners!  I am pleading for you to do it right, or not do it all.</p>
